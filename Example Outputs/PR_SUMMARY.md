# Image Optimization PR

This PR implements image optimization for all images in the repository, converting them to the WebP format according to the following rules:

1. Regular images → WebP with 80% quality compression
2. Images with transparency → Lossless WebP format
3. Only keeping WebP versions where file size was reduced

## Summary of Optimizations

- **Total original size**: 1915.97 KB
- **Total WebP size**: 128.45 KB
- **Total reduction**: 1787.52 KB (93.30%)
- **Number of images converted**: 8

## Detailed Results

| Original File | Format | Dimensions | Original Size (KB) | WebP Size (KB) | Reduction (%) |
|---------------|--------|------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| keyboard.png | PNG | 1024x1024 | 1836.63 | 105.81 | 94.24% |
| GitHub_Lockup_Dark.png | PNG | 1531x375 | 19.15 | 6.56 | 65.74% |
| GitHub_Invertocat_Dark.png | PNG | 407x400 | 9.10 | 3.33 | 63.40% |
| GitHub_Lockup_Light.png | PNG | 1531x375 | 17.63 | 6.56 | 62.78% |
| GitHub_Invertocat_Light.png | PNG | 407x400 | 8.57 | 3.33 | 61.14% |
| sample.jpg | JPG | 300x200 | 1.58 | 0.19 | 87.89% |
| sample2.jpg | JPG | 800x600 | 8.04 | 0.93 | 88.39% |
| sample3.jpg | JPG | 1200x800 | 15.26 | 1.73 | 88.69% |

## Notes on Implementation

- The most dramatic reduction was achieved with `keyboard.png`, which was reduced by 94.24% from 1.8MB to just 105KB
- All GitHub logo images with transparency were converted using lossless WebP to preserve transparency
- JPG images were converted using lossy WebP with 80% quality, achieving around 88% reduction in file size
- All original image files are preserved in the repository alongside their WebP versions
- No images were excluded as all WebP versions were smaller than their originals

## Next Steps

To fully utilize these optimized images, the repository would need to update any references to use the WebP versions of the images.
